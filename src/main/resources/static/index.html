                <ul>
                    <li>Any member's membership payments must be fully up to date to remain eligible for any benefits.</li>
                    <li>New members may choose a backdated join date as early as July 1, 2020, provided all required membership payments for the selected period have been paid in full.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If July 1, 2020 is selected as the join date, the registration fee will be waived.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>To be consistent, all join dates and marital status changes are recorded as the first day of the month following the qualification or event.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="heads">Marital Status Changes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a member gets married, their status must change to married starting from the first day of the month following the marriage. Monthly contributions will increase to the Married rate (1.5Ã— the unmarried rate) from that month onward.</li>
                    <li>If a Married member marital status changed to unmarried (e.g., through divorce or separation), changing their status to unmarried starting from the first day of the month following the status change is optional (not mandatory). If a member choose to change, monthly contributions will decrease to the unmarried rate. Note: this will affect ownership percentage.</li>
                </ul>
